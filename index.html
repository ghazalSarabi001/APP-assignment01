        Imagine a world where nearly everyone is born with a superpower, known
        as a "Quirk." In this society, heroes and villains clash in spectacular
        battles, shaping the very fabric of society. Now, picture a young boy
        named Izuku Midoriya, who dreams of becoming the greatest hero of all
        time. There's just one problem: he was born without a Quirk.

        My Hero Academia is a thrilling anime that takes you on an emotional
        rollercoaster, exploring the themes of perseverance, bravery, and the
        true meaning of heroism. It follows Izuku's journey as he defies all
        odds to enroll in U.A. High School, the premier institution for aspiring

        by his classmates, Izuku learns that being a hero is about more than
        just having powerâ€”it's about having the heart to use it.

      <h2>Why I like My Hero Academia?</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          I find the overarching plot of Deku's growth and the development of
          the League of Villains most engaging. The various story arcs, such as
          the Sports Festival and the Hero Internship, provide thrilling and
          emotional moments that keep me hooked.
        </li>
        <li>
          The character development in My Hero Academia is impressive. I
          particularly enjoy watching the growth of Bakugo from a hot-headed
          rival to someone who begins to understand the true meaning of heroism.
          Similarly, Todoroki's journey of self-acceptance and dealing with his
          past is very compelling.
        </li>
        <li>
          The concept of Quirks is fascinating and adds a unique twist to the
          superhero genre. The portrayal of heroism, emphasizing courage,
          selflessness, and the will to protect others, is both inspiring and
          thought-provoking. I find Eraser Head's Quirk, which can cancel out
          others' Quirks, particularly intriguing due to its strategic
          implications
